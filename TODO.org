* Business Plan
  Start off by going to local printers. Search for the best printers
  in Brooklyn/Manhattan. Offer to strike a deal with them. The deal
  is this:
  - They print the orders you take from your website. Either they ship
    them to the customer or you ship them.
  - They take a large cut of the payment - over 50%, since they are
    the ones absorbing all the material costs.
  - You observe how the printing process works and eventually you
    purchase your own machines and cut out the middle man.
